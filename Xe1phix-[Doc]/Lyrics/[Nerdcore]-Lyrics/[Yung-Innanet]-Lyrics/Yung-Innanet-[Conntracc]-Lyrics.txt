Yes Im creep creep creep creep creepin around your subnet
You can ask the BBS theyll tell you that im up next
Compromise a PBX, defraud them with the phone sex
We in y2k-20 passwords still stored in plaintext
What the fuck you thinkin your heart is gonna be sinkin
When I get to that database and get to leakin
Good game headshot
Killtacular
Im Dracula
I'm drainin life from these lames that do not 2 factor auth
Oh bitch thats right
Pulled a fast one on ya
I dont need yo computer and I dont need your ip number
I be parsin stolen data while these pussies be slumberin
Know I need the booty so I proceed onto plunderin
Thunder and lightening it is so exciting
The data contained within these clouds is so inciting
Shells electrifying via netcat piping
Persistence is surviving
In your kernel hiding
Persistence is surviving
In your kernel hiding
Shells be so exciting
Dun dun dun dun dun

Thunder and lightening it is so exciting

No I ain't gone you really arent that lucky yet
Closed that port but conntrack say established
Reverse to a hop before my IP hit the blacklist
Encapsulate the packets, ain't making no racket
Lay low, till I pivot thats my tactic
Dont wait to long, white hats will unpack it
Easy on them packets, UDP no SYN-ACKin
Minimal traffic, hidden inside a brackets
Always assume that an anti is sniffin pcapin
Meticulous move is no cuttin corners we not craftin
Wait for the RSA keys an then we get to fucking jacking
Inside the loot is another target we attacking

Yung snat, black hat, never heard of him
Yes that is on purpose
Alternative handles lurkin
Scanning yo attack surface
Databases no wordlist
I create disturbance
On your internet service
