(im an internet pirate) starship pilot
trying to keep my actions private
wardial it product of the 1980s spectrum ultraviolet
deep purple smoke on the water till the bottom fall out
of all this hacking im doing till my rep is in ruin
tryin to make the best of a movement
steady pursuing a fluency to see what theyll do to me

im an internet virus
proficient with devices that require a stylus
i admit i got a bias towards any batch of silicon that be rockin a BIOS
dont DENY this firewall rules apply this
puter hepatitis all on disc sell a fix
call it ransomware get me a handsome heir
for the throne when my ass be gone

i got a phone (tether up)
riding on chrome (talking bout the browser pup)
im a force of nature rpg pen and the paper
code breaker data scraper
admin on a rampage the spampage
beckoning a series of clicks on my cam page
im showing my damn age
everytime i reminisce about the "good ol days"

but them days aint over
cuz im still up on the block standing head and shoulders
in them inbox folders out foxin mulders with a method
that will leave the block smoldered
cuz im a dragon dictating my ethos
the beat goes on and i hack the gibson
root admission bitching bout the government mission
on attrition pimpin whos the master of this science fiction

(im an internet bandit) stoned as granite
trying to keep my landers landed
then spam it collect a bunch of clicks on a hypertext canvas
do my damndest to keep the advantage
brandishing a package of packets of dirty bandwidth
to jam with build a stack and feed em a sandwich
from a campus box that i rooted in the middle of kansas

my fans is loyal and im leading that charge like a red alert tesla coil
from us soil stateside solid state drive
encoded with the data that i need to survive
against a hive mind drones that would stand to deny mine
how they treat us hackers it would serve as a guide line
1984 they got a fix on the timeline
i grind mine in the name of computer crime i'm

vicious - still all about the business
holding grudges and forgoing forgiveness
cause i witness people on the scene with a sickness
snitching on their friends for a deal with a quickness
hammond hit a backdoor broke up into stratfor
on the orders of a government actor
but they dont factor any of that in his sentencing
"hes menacing; an anarchist subversive whos peddling

the wrong ideology"
get them hackers to follow me 'fore they bottle me
cause i gotta be an oddity set up in the music economy
theyre on to me cause im still a computer prodigy
no modesty when it comes to hacking the planet
spitting on a microphone or puffing organic
represent defendants like im jennifer granick
hacker mechanic sending science all across the atlantic
dont panic
