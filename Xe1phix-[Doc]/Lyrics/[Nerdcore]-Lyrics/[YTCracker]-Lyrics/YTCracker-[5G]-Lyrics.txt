YTCracker-[5G]

i aint wanna talk on the mobile if you gonna yodel hit me with the POCSAG global 
feel a little buzz on my scrotal king of the internet i keep it noble some days - 
feel a return to the old ways even in my old age 
so i love when the ol' page come through with the whole blaze 
while the feds giving me the cold gaze cant even talk on the stringed cans - 
one slip and they bring vans see em komen like the pink bands 
try to ruin how i spring plans mapping networks with the ping scans 
shouts to my big stans server blades stay the blades of my big fans 
yung innanet and i still keep it clutch like a flywheel with our silence be the ideal
