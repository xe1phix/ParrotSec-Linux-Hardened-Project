**Android Vulnerabilities Overview (AVO) is a databse of known security vulnerabilities in Android.**

The vulnerabilities database is splitted into seperate .md files to get an better and cleaner overview. 
The current 2016 list is avaible over [here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Android-Vulnerabilities-Overview/blob/master/2016.md).



_The security flaw gives hacker ability to spy on Android smartphone owners, steal login credentials, install malware, and many more, according to the latest research conducted by the researchers at the Pennsylvania State University and FireEye._

Warning
--------

Do not install security updates like _CVE-2015-1538.apk_ from untrusted sources! It's a trap! 


Security updates are rolled out by Google Play-services (in background) or as ROM update directly from your provider and never comes as single .APK!

Forensics analysis software and apps
--------

In most cases Trojans/Malware only sending 'stuff' to there C&C's if you're on wifi (to not getting easier detected by the bandwidth consumptation itself), of course they often drain your battery, so some tools are to detect such cases and identifys them (like Hush) such tools can be used to reveal what exactly going on behind the scenes.

‘Stingrays’ Cell Phone Trackers
--------

Stingrays, made by the Harris Corporation, has capabilities to access user's unique IDs and phone numbers, track and record locations, and sometimes even intercept Internet traffic and phone calls, send fake texts and install spyware on phones. 
The authorities used these tracking tools for years to breach people's privacy and did everything to keep even the existence of these devices out of the public eye. They even avoid telling judges when they used them.
