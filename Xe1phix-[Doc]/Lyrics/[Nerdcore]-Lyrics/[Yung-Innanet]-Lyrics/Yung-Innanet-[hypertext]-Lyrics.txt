hollows in my magazine feelin real nervous
cause i might just get shot
greppin these logs all night from a remote host i call honeypot

who you think you are, you a mothafuckin stain
might as well be a fuckin chat bot
i don't fuck with lames cause my crew full of hitters
on the innanet or the street lot

i don't really care you can get it anywhere
betta have yourself a real good plot
i be dead inside - you can see it in my eyes
if we tango one of us is gonna rot

i don't really care about the cops
i don't smoke weed i smoke opps
askin bout my data, it's a lot
keep it layered so i don't get caught

raid spinnin so my drives stay hot
cold wallets air gapped stay locked
9 millimeter round up top
call my lawyer i don't wanna fuccin talk

no questions

yung innanet in the buildin
fuck what they feelin
rsyslogd missed me so i'm stealin
for the fuckin thrill an
grindin for a million
nerdy hoodrat no cap can you feel this

hyper text transfer protocol
i take a fucking stroll right past your firewall
meet me on port 80 if you think that you can brawl
before you know what hit you watch your uptime fall

cross platform

and i don't need a fuckin packet storm
script kiddy lamers couldn't reveal a fuckin password form
make ya smash every key on ya keyboard
load the IDE code malware when i'm fuckin bored

that's all i know

and i got that super user flow
bumpin ytc as i'm stackin all this dough
tried to view your webpage but that shit would not load
apache got a codeine habit - movin real slow

got keys for days and my whole crew packin
say that you a hacker but your knowledge steady lackin
you said that you could own but we all know what the facts is
you runnin windows 7 and yo linksys droppin packets

tcpdump and about 2 hours
have ya infrastructure fallin like the twin towers
camoflaugin interface as L2 routers
you sit and play games you a fuckin coward
