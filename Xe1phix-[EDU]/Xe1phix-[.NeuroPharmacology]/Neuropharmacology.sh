When an action potential
travelling along a nerve fibre reaches a nerve terminal, a
host of ion channels open. Calcium ions enter through
these channels into the interior of the terminal. These
ions migrate from the channel exits to release sites on
vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules. A
triggering effect of the calcium ions causes these
contents to be dumped into the synaptic cleft that
separates this terminal from a neighbouring neuron,
and these neurotransmitter molecules influence the
tendencies of that neighbouring neuron to ‘fire’.


At their narrowest points, calcium ion channels are
less than a nanometre in diameter (Cataldi et al. 2002).
This extreme smallness of the opening in the calcium
ion channels has profound quantum mechanical
implications. The narrowness of the channel restricts
the lateral spatial dimension. Consequently, the lateral
velocity is forced by the quantum uncertainty principle to
become large. This causes the quantum cloud of
possibilities associated with the calcium ion to fan out
over an increasing area as it moves away from the tiny
channel to the target region where the ion will be
absorbed as a whole, or not absorbed at all, on some
small triggering site.

This spreading of this ion wave packet means that the
ion may or may not be absorbed on the small triggering
site. Accordingly, the contents of the vesicle may or
may not be released. Consequently, the quantum state
of the brain has a part in which the neurotransmitter is
released and a part in which the neurotransmitter is not
released. This quantum splitting occurs at every one of
the trillions of nerve terminals. This means that the
quantum state of the brain splits into a vast host of
classically conceived possibilities, one for each possible
combination of the release-or-no-release options at
each of the nerve terminals. In fact, because of
uncertainties on timings and locations, what is gener-
ated by the physical processes in the brain will be not a
single discrete set of non-overlapping physical possibi-
lities but rather a huge smear of classically conceived
possibilities.
