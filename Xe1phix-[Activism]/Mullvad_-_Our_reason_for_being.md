 Mullvad - Our reason for being

As our habits change and our lives are shared online, 
the necessity to seriously consider all aspects of online privacy increases.

This is because most of our online searches, posts, shares, tweets, 
and pics are not only seen by others but can potentially also be used against us.
 
There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch

Search engines and social media sell our personal information to private corporations every day. 
And at the same time, companies and governments are methodically gathering more and more knowledge about us. 
We believe that this can be dangerous since certain opinions and actions which are socially accepted today may become frowned upon or even illegal in the future.

The ability to control and manage our individual privacy has become crucially dependent upon security. Without security, you have no guarantee that your information will remain private. That’s why we exist.
 
For the universal right: privacy

Privacy is fundamental to a well-functioning society, because it allows norms, ethics, and laws to be safely discussed and challenged. Its absence leads to a repressed and withering public discourse, which only serves the malevolent. A free and open society, therefore, cannot flourish and develop nor exist without privacy. That is why privacy is paramount, and why we strive to make internet censorship and mass surveillance ineffective.

For the universal right to privacy,
Mullvad
