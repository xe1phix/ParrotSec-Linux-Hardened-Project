802.11 Lyrics
Creeping down the mother fucking block
What it do
You can call me yung snat
Yeah bitch who is you
Airmon-NG dumping eight oh two
And I got kitty cats in my GPU
Hey cousin whats your PSK
U B N T
Rockets on my roof
Bitch I dont play
Nanobeams for the team
We some wifi fiends
Scanning SSID's Cracking WPA
Yeah, turn the gain up
Shut a stains wifi off if he dont pay up
Ain't no fucking game we them god damn raiders
And I got a sweet tooth suck me off Now and Later
Cat6 in the cut
Wifi on the roof
Pringles can in the whip
Packet dumping for the loot
Feeding cyanide to your arp table imma snoop
See you walk real slow share the booty with the crew
Eight oh two eleven
Send a stupid ass to heaven
Right hand siggy
Left hand 211
Signal strength boomin
Im connecting all my brethren
I keep the data moving for all my packet reverends
Yeah bitch
Fuck the internet we local
Teach a hood rat a new way to use his mobile
You dont gotta use that social if you know just how that net work
Fuck the federalies they have connections that they lurk
When in doubt, wipe down
Never talk, pipe down
Hit em with, dirty rounds
Now they ain't making sounds
While I'm riding through my town Imma let my speakers pound
You know I'm a dog, I'm a mother fucking hound
Bark bark bitch lets run this fade
Switch lights blinking like a god damn arcade
These boys gonna learn today
Debts will always become paid
Eight oh two eleven cameras jammed no replay
