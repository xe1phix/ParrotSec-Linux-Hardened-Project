1.0 Planning and Scoping
------------------------

1.1 Explain the importance of planning for an engagement.

• Understanding the target audience: Understanding the readers of the report and 
					who the pentest is for.  Security Policy of organization
					lays out rules for all members that have access.
					Regulations for company, ex. HIPPA? Federal? Finacial?
					Understanding concerns: DOS, disclosures, embarassment
• Rules of engagement(ROE): Lays out scheduled time of test, contacts, measurements of gained access,
			    the systems to be tested, presentation of results.  ROE can also include
			    what is off limit and what tactics are included. DOS? Social Engineering?
			    	  
			

• Communication escalation path: Who will be notified of the test?  If an incident occurs who will be notified

• Resources and requirements

	- Confidentiality of findings: Roughly protecting the privacy of the organization and 
					the members within.  Preventing findings from authorized
					release and protecting against releasing PII with NDA.

	- Known vs. unknown: knowledge of system and network.  with info or without 
				pertaining to info about host and network configurations

• Budget: Cost of pentest versus a breach.  Factors for cost may include complexity, 
					    method, experience, location, and remediation.
	  				    Ranging from $4,000 to $20,000

• Impact analysis and
 remediation timelines: Included in impact analysis determines the potential consequences of the vulnerablities
			and remediation time to patches/updates and retesting for confirmation

• Disclaimers
	- Point-in-time assessment(PITA):tracks progress over a point in time and disclaims for that time when the test was done

	- Comprehensiveness: No warranties or or protections of damage provided by pen testers 
			     Part of planing phase, can include baselines, standards, best practices

• Technical constraints: Listing out what methods are allowed.  What is not allowed
			Third party contraints, needing written permission.  What host, 
			ip ranges, and applications are inlcuded. 

• Support resources
	- WSDL/WADL: Web Services Description Language/Web Application Description Language
		     machine readable XML description of HTTP-based web services.  Description of web services.  WSDL is SOAP(Simple Obeject Access Protocol)
		     A WSDL description contains all the details of a Web service, including: 
		     The service's URL, the communication mechanisms it understands, what operations it can perform, the structure of its messages. 
		     file extenstion:.wsdl
		      
	
	- SOAP project file: Simple Object Access Protocol, protocol for exchanging structured info via web services. Allows communication with XML
				May contain an HTTP message with Host info, content, version, 
	- SDK documentation: Software development kits documentation or devkit describes the dev tools used for applications, software packages, APIs, header files,
				libraries, samples, usuage 

	- Swagger document:The Swagger document specifies the list of resources that are available in the REST API and the operations that can be called on those resources.

	- XSD(XML Schema Definition):describes the elements and attributes permitted in a XML language. Defines and specifies the use of XML 
	
	- Sample application requests: API requests documenting and describing requests.  Can give details about a program

	- Architectural diagrams: can show strucutes, networking nodes, and communication or a network or system

_______________________________________________________________-
1.2 Explain key legal concepts.

• Contracts

	- SOW: Statement of Work outlines work that is going to be performed.  Describing purpose then outlining what steps are taken in the pentest, 
		i.e. discovery, exploitation, status, communication. 

	- MSA: Master Services Agreement, executed on sales order.  Covers services, work, definition, fees, laws, liability, contractual provisions.

	- NDA: Non Disclosure agreement.  Protects both the pentester and client.  Commitment to keep all confidential information and the findings safe.
		Document that is signed for managments assurance that all collected information is protected. 

• Environmental differences
	-Export restrictions: Government restrictions and regulations on exports.  Regulations on software, data, and tech.

	-Local and national: Laws between transfering data and expoorts between states and countries 

 government restrictions: Other nations may infringe on a pentest depending on the laws and restrictions. 
	- Corporate policies

• Written authorization

	- Obtain signature from
 	proper signing authority: Importance of signitures for liability and contracts

	- Third-party provider
 	authorization when necessary:  Issues with granting authority when outside vendors are involved with a company

_________________________________________________________________
1.3 Explain the importance of scoping an engagement properly.

• Types of assessment

	- Goals-based/objectives-based:planning out a pentest, goals defined before pentest, 
					Goals include: gaining access, privesc, exfil (https://spl0it.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/goal-oriented-pentesting-the-new-process-for-penetration-testing/)

	- Compliance-based: Pentest testing the policies and security measures are in place

	- Red team:more of a targeted assesment, testes organization and response.  
		   Can take up to 3-4 weeks, use social engineering, wireless, external, and more.
	 	   Using exploits and similar to a pentest. Can be used to test incident response
		   https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/06/23/penetration-testing-vs-red-teaming-the-age-old-debate-of-pirates-vs-ninja-continues/
	

• Special scoping considerations

	- Premerger: combination of two or more corporations to one company. Before a merger, scope considering who is authorizing entity

	- Supply chain: considerations include resources for supplies in IT, network, data.  Security measures for reducing risk from threats to supply resources   

• Target selection

	- Targets

	 - Internal: targets within a network or area

	 - On-site vs. off-site: loaction of attack if onsite may include people networks. Off-site includes, not at site, perhaps an offsite server or help desk.

	 - External: targets outside of a internal company or site

	 - First-party vs. third-party hosted: first party is hosted by company, third party by outside vendor

	 - Physical: devices and locations themselves can be targets bypassing security controls 

 	- Users: Usernames for targets

 	- SSIDs: Service set identifier for wireless, techinical term for a network name 
 	
	- Applications: identifying application types and versions for targeting

	- Considerations: Considering what targets are most vulnerable or priorities for company 

 	- White-listed vs. black-listed: White=allowed or permitted users, apps, urls.  Black listed= block or not used apps,URLs, users

 	- Security exceptions: exceptions to security for targeting include ways around security 

 	- IPS/WAF whitelist: Testing what prevention measures are taken in an IPS and what web apps are blocked in a WAF

 	- NAC: Network access controls unifies endpoint security.  AV, HIPS, VATs, Authentication, Netsec policy.

 	- Certificate pinning: Certificate and Public Key pinning once a certificate is known of a host it is pinned to ahost 

 	- Company’s policies: companies policies are considered for target selection and testing

• Strategy
	- Black box: simulating outside hackers with no prior inside knowledge of org architecture
		  
	- White box: Authenticate test, full knowledge ot IT infrastrucure. Including diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, creds.

	- gray box:  Inbetween black and white, having some knowledge. Defining knowledge at the start of the pentest 

• Risk acceptance: Assuming risk and testing risk in a pentest with a defined scope 

• Tolerance to impact:  Accepting risk associated with the impact of pentest 

• Scheduling: Schedules and dates are importance for a scope

• Scope creep: when a client adds or appends scope, adding more work for a pentest

• Threat actors: malicious actor responsible for incidents

	- Adversary tier: 

 	- APT: advanced persistant threat

 	- Script kiddies: non technical hackers that use others scripts

 	- Hacktivist: attacking or defacing for political reasons
