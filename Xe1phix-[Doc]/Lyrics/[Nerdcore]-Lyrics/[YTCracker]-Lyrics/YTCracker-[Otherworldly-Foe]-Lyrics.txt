YTCracker-[Otherworldly-Foe]

[Verse 1]
Adium with the OTR
Jabber on and away from the law
You inspector gadget and they the doctor claw
Trying to get the penny and the brain and all
VPN on the offshore islands
And they make every effort to silence
They fear what they don't understand and they can't control
But they can't put a cork on your soul
Man they make it harder to trust
They can turn a close homie into federal busts
They can flip a little switch and have 'em sniffing the cuts
Then you're sitting in a van with your wrists in the cuffs
You can take the precautions
Guarding your identity like proof of the martians
But the odds that you're getting betrayed
Logarithmically increase with the passing of days
[Hook x2]
Just an otherworldly foe
Your life change when they kick in the door
Ain't nothing been the same and your faith is low
But you don't cave 'til the game give a fatal blow

[Verse 2]
Chain as strong as the weakest link
One leak and the whole boat sink
That's why you gotta keep it anon like Mr. Pink
Or the reservoir will swallow you up in one drink
Now I didn't write the rules
But the game ain't changed since I was hacking my schools
I done made the same mistakes in pursuit of the truth
Tried to hold the fam together like I'm Michael Bluth
Instead I'm Gob, ninety thousand dollar suit
In a courtroom telling judges how they don't recruit
The proper talent to compute; we just punish and dilute
All the spirit in our youth to compete global
Tell our kids that whistle-blowing isn't noble
Unless you're snitching on a hacker - propaganda goebbels
Give him life just for hacking into mobiles
And raise incarceration totals, shit
