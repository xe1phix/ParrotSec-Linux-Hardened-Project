Virsh is a command line utility for managing KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) guests. This is its cheat sheet.

The material that follows comes from a post by Jaime Frutos Morales in 2010. Many thanks to Jaime for bringing this info together in such a clear and concise way. In kvm terms guests are referred to as domains, so in the examples that follow "nameofdomain" would be replaced by something like "linuxtest1".

virsh list --all

Show info about a domain:

virsh dominfo nameofdomain
