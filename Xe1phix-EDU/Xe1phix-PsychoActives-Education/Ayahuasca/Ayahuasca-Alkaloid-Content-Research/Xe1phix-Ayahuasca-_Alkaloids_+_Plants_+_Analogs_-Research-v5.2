                but rather have its own activity potentiated by MAO inhibition.


				
				
				

      >  [?] In the pineal gland MAO is the primary inactivation pathway of serotonin, 
	         a neurotransmitter synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. 
      >  [?] If MAO is blocked by harmine, harmaline or other MAO inhibitors 
	         serotonin can be converted by the methyltransferase enzymes 
			 HIOMT and INMT into psychedelic tryptamines
