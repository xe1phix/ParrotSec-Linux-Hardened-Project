Hatebreed â€“ Something's Off Lyrics

There's a beast in every man who breathes
With him from birth until beside him in the grave
A hideous presence just aching for release
Its chains aren't as strong as its memory
It lies dormant so far from dead
Grating on me, this uninvited sense
Its whisper like branches as they bend
Twisting, grinding
Just threatening to snap
Floods of frustration
Cascading in my skull
On the axis back and forth the swinging pendulum
So much damage, bashing each wall
I hear the sand pounding in the hourglass as it falls
Sometimes I just wish I could shut it all off, off
The endless rage, that tells me something's off, off
The voice that's spitting lies, just turn it off, off
Tear away the scabs, I want them off, off
The demon on my back, just pull him off
There it is again
Telling you you can't
That lump in your throat you fight to swallow back
There it is again
Hoping that you won't
Wishing failure but not giving up the ghost
Silent voices, stabbing at peace
Pushing off fingers from the ledge of sanity
Like a thousand leeches
Feeding on your wits
Making something meaningless seem significant
Sometimes I just wish I could shut it all off, off
The endless rage, that tells me something's off, off
The voice that's spitting lies, just turn it off, off
Tear away the scabs, I want them off, off
The demon on my back, just pull him off
This uninvited guest inside my brain
With every threat whispered I feel nothing
And when I'm at my best it intervenes
How can I get anyone else to relate?
Silent voices, stabbing at peace
On the edge, pushing my fingers off
Off
Off, off
The endless rage, that tells me something's off, off
The voice that's spitting lies, just turn it off, off
Tear away the scabs, I want them off, off
The demon on my back, just tear him off
