# 1. Download a Single File #
#############################
The following command will get the content of the URL and display it in the STDOUT (i.e on your terminal).
$ curl http://strategicsec.com

To store the output in a file, you an redirect it as shown below. This will also display some additional download statistics.
$ curl http://strategicsec.com > strategicsec-com.html


#####################################
# 2. Save the cURL Output to a file #
#####################################
We can save the result of the curl command to a file by using -o/-O options.
	•	-o (lowercase o) the result will be saved in the filename provided in the command line
	•	-O (uppercase O) the filename in the URL will be taken and it will be used as the filename to store the result

$ curl -o bye.txt http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/SpamAssassin/SpamAssassin-127.2/SpamAssassin/t/data/etc/hello.txt 
Now the page hello.txt will be saved in the file named ‘bye.txt’. 
You can also note that when running curl with -o option, it displays the progress meter for the download as follows.

When you use curl -O (uppercase O), it will save the content in the file named ‘hello.txt’ itself in the local machine.

$ curl -O http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/SpamAssassin/SpamAssassin-127.2/SpamAssassin/t/data/etc/hello.txt
Note: When curl has to write the data to the terminal, it disables the Progress Meter, to avoid confusion in printing. We can use ‘>’|’-o’|’-O’ options to move the result to a file.

##################################################
# 3. Follow HTTP Location Headers with -L option #
##################################################
By default CURL doesn’t follow the HTTP Location headers. It is also termed as Redirects. When a requested web page is moved to another place, then an HTTP Location header will be sent as a Response and it will have where the actual web page is located.
For example, when someone types google.com in the browser from India, it will be automatically redirected to ‘google.co.in’. This is done based on the HTTP Location header as shown below.

$ curl --head http://www.strategicsec.com		You'll see that you only get the 301

$ curl --head -L http://www.strategicsec.com		You'll see that you get the 301, and the 200 OK

##########################################
# 4. Continue/Resume a Previous Download #
##########################################
Using curl -C option, you can continue a download which was stopped already for some reason. This will be helpful when you download large files, and the download got interrupted.
If we say ‘-C -‘, then curl will find from where to start resuming the download. We can also give an offset ‘-C <offset>’. The given offset bytes will be skipped from the beginning for the source file.
Start a big download using curl, and press Ctrl-C to stop it in between the download.

$ curl -O http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2015/05/appsec-gaps-between-builders-and.html
##############             20.1%
Note: -# is used to display a progress bar instead of a progress meter.
Now the above download was stopped at 20.1%. Using “curl -C -“, we can continue the download from where it left off earlier. Now the download continues from 20.1%.

curl -C - -O http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2015/05/appsec-gaps-between-builders-and.html
###############            21.1%

# 5. Test for XMLRPC Pingback Vuln #
######################################
$ curl -D - "strategicsec.com/xmlrpc.php" -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -d '<methodCall><methodName>pingback.ping</methodName><params><param><value><string>http://dojo.com/</string></value></param></methodcall>'


######################################
# 6. Limit the Rate of Data Transfer #
######################################
You can limit the amount at which the data gets transferred using –limit-rate option. You can specify the maximum transfer rate as argument.
$ curl --limit-rate 1000B -O http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2015/05/appsec-gaps-between-builders-and.html
The above command is limiting the data transfer to 1000 Bytes/second. curl may use higher transfer rate for short span of time. But on an average, it will come around to 1000B/second.


#########################################################################
# 7. Download a file only if it is modified before/after the given time #
#########################################################################
We can get the files that are modified after a particular time using -z option in curl. This will work for both FTP & HTTP.
$ curl -z 21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html
The above command will download the yy.html only if it is modified later than the given date and time
$ curl -z -21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html
The above command will download the yy.html, if it is modified before than the given date and time.
Please refer ‘man curl_getdate’ for the various syntax supported for the date expression

#######################################
# 8. Pass HTTP Authentication in cURL #
#######################################
Sometime, websites will require a username and password to view the content ( can be done with .htaccess file ). With the help of -u option, we can pass those credentials from cURL to the web server as shown below.
$ curl -u username:password URL
Note: By default curl uses Basic HTTP Authentication. We can specify other authentication method using –ntlm | –digest.

#####################################
# 9. Download Files from FTP server #
#####################################
cURL can also be used to download files from FTP servers. If the given FTP path is a directory, by default it will list the files under the specific directory.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/xss.php
The above command will download the xss.php file from the ftp server and save it in the local directory.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/
Here, the given URL refers to a directory. So cURL will list all the files and directories under the given URL
If you are new to FTP/sFTP, refer ftp sftp tutorial for beginners.

##################################
# 10. List/Download using Ranges #
##################################
cURL supports ranges to be given in the URL. When a range is given, files matching within the range will be downloaded. It will be helpful to download packages from the FTP mirror sites.
$ curl   ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/pool/main/[a-z]/
The above command will list out all the packages from a-z ranges in the terminal.

##################################
# 11. Upload Files to FTP Server #
##################################
Curl can also be used to upload files to the FTP server with -T option.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T myfile.txt ftp://ftp.testserver.com
The above command will upload the file named myfile.txt to the FTP server. You can also upload multiple files at a same time using the range operations.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T "{file1,file2}" ftp://ftp.testserver.com
Optionally we can use “.” to get the input from STDIN and transfer to the remote.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T - ftp://ftp.testserver.com/myfile_1.txt
The above command will get the input from the user from Standard Input and save the contents in the ftp server under the name ‘myfile_1.txt’.
You can provide one ‘-T’ for each URL and the pair specifies what to upload where.

#######################################################
# 12. More Information using Verbose and Trace Option #
#######################################################
You can get to know what is happening using the -v option. -v option enable the verbose mode and it will print the details
curl -v http://strategicsec.com
The about command will output the following

####################################################
# 13. Get Definition of a Word using DICT Protocol #
####################################################
You can use cURL to get the definition for a word with the help of DICT protocol. We need to pass a Dictionary Server URL to it.
$ curl dict://dict.org/d:bash
The above command will list the meaning for bash as follows
jargon "The Jargon File (version 4.4.7, 29 Dec 2003)"
foldoc "The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (26 July 2010)"
easton "Easton's 1Now you can see that it uses “The Collaborative International Dictionary of English”. There are many dictionaries are available. We can list all the dictionaries using


####################################
# 14. Use Proxy to Download a File #
####################################
We can specify cURL to use proxy to do the specific operation using -x option. We need to specify the host and port of the proxy.
$ curl -x proxysever.test.com:3128 http://strategicsec.com


#####################################
# 15. Send Mail using SMTP Protocol #
#####################################
cURL can also be used to send mail using the SMTP protocol. You should specify the from-address, to-address, and the mailserver ip-address as shown below.
$ curl --mail-from blah@test.com --mail-rcpt foo@test.com smtp://mailserver.com
Once the above command is entered, it will wait for the user to provide the data to mail. Once you’ve composed your message, type . (period) as the last line, which will send the email immediately.
