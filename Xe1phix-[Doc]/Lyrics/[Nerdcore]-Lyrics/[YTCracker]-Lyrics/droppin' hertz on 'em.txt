mic damager whodi who still spamming ya
hemorrhage brain stems with memorable space jams
i don't give a damn bout how them antis be speaking
i got a campaign in the hopper and i'm blasting all weekend
i got that fri-day mentality
not rebecca black but ice to the third power
and like a whiskey and sour
you can find me in the mix more often than not
cuz my beats knock i got that wub wub wobble
and i like the filthy filthy shit yes it's hard to swallow
that my following on twitter got combined IQ
of a hundred million billion cuz we're smarter than you

we got that nerd flu - we sick with the hustle
while we built on computers yes you might've built your muscle
but we built the internet and telephone networks
dg pull your doc like threads on a sweatshirt

dropping hertz on em
bitch i got gigs in the bag
dropping hertz on em
give em nerd life fly the flag
dropping hertz on em
listen to me newbie dont laugh
i do math motherfucker do the math motherfucker

x2

i dont want to ffucking asdo apaopadsstroapeuhes anymorea OHAHISHDSKJasam

most the people that decipher my lyrics we kin spirits
cuz we obviously share the same interests so go pimp this
in your whip or cage TEMPEST michael faraday narrative
cant resist these nerdy genes i inherited

"yea you best secure your password"
the last words that you heard before we rooted ya son
im under tutelage of one the Spam God - Praise
get up on the Internet and show me your ways

i havent slept in days bawls and vault bottles on the floor
littering the path to the office door (tell me more)
got a jailbreak on the sly from coders at dev-team
iOS show a pwnapple up on that load screen

im a living dream - im living proof that it works
to put the word hertz in a song and move it along
without the slightest bit of pain connotated at all
well maybe just a little bit i dont want to look too soft

there really aren't lyrics here but you might be reading
this thinking these are the lyrics but i am just saying hello
because i am very scientific i am organic matter
thank you very much holler sir

baby take it off - change your permissions a bit
get an array made of legs if i run a quick split()
youd be surprised at how that pick up line does at the bars
in silicon valley with them nerd rock stars

dropping hertz on em
bitch i got gigs in the bag
dropping hertz on em
give em nerd life fly the flag
dropping hertz on em
listen to me newbie dont laugh
i do math motherfucker do the math motherfucker
