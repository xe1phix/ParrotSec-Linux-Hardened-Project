The Penrose–Hameroff model requires that the quantum state of the brain has a property called Macroscopic Quantum Coherence.

When an action potential travelling along a nerve fibre reaches a nerve terminal, a
host of ion channels open. Calcium ions enter through these channels into the interior of the terminal. 
These ions migrate from the channel exits to release sites on vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules. 
A triggering effect of the calcium ions causes these contents to be dumped into the synaptic cleft that
separates this terminal from a neighbouring neuron, and these neurotransmitter molecules influence the
tendencies of that neighbouring neuron to ‘fire’.


At their narrowest points, calcium ion channels are less than a nanometre in diameter (Cataldi et al. 2002).
This extreme smallness of the opening in the calcium ion channels has profound quantum mechanical
implications. The narrowness of the channel restricts the lateral spatial dimension. Consequently, the lateral
velocity is forced by the quantum uncertainty principle to become large. This causes the quantum cloud of
possibilities associated with the calcium ion to fan out over an increasing area as it moves away from the tiny
channel to the target region where the ion will be absorbed as a whole, or not absorbed at all, on some
small triggering site.


This spreading of this ion wave packet means that the ion may or may not be absorbed on the small triggering
site. Accordingly, the contents of the vesicle may or may not be released. Consequently, the quantum state
of the brain has a part in which the neurotransmitter is released and a part in which the neurotransmitter is not
released. This quantum splitting occurs at every one of the trillions of nerve terminals. This means that the
quantum state of the brain splits into a vast host of classically conceived possibilities, one for each possible
combination of the release-or-no-release options at each of the nerve terminals. In fact, because of
uncertainties on timings and locations, what is generated by the physical processes in the brain will be not a
single discrete set of non-overlapping physical possibilities but rather a huge smear of classically conceived
possibilities.
