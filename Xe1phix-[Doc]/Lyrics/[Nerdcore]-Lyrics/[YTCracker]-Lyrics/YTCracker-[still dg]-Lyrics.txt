go fuck yourself hack the planet

10 years later ain't a damn thing changed

Late in the evening, or is it morning?
Couple days sat awake and i see me yawnin'
James Bondin', pinging and they ain't respondin'
Mission accomplished, yeah, bitch, I'm pwning
Roll out the crib, white hat on the crest
"Spamtec" like a badge on the right of my chest
Blip-blip on my Sidekick, I flip my wrist
SSH to my box page down to next
My stats look good, what about my checks?
So many digits, it's a googleplex
Rotation of the earth like my spam subjects
Perplex the best, the wicked get no rest
Slide in my Chrysler, the blades will slice ya'
Mesh grill on the front just to entice ya'
IPod in the dash, Nerd Life supreme
Track, track, to the Spamtec audio stream
Still live my life like the perfect dream
There ain't a soul that can touch me or my team, nah
District attorneys set out on journeys
And then I lead them on like "A Weekend at Bernie's"
Feds on the scene, try collectin' my convos
See me on AIM talkin' to all the blond hos
it's Condos, coast to coast, wireless enabled
When they set to sniff I switch to cables
IPs bounce through multi nations
I keep confidential like doctors' patients
It's Nerd Life and it's DG death
Represent DG 'til my dying breath

I'm still a DG and I ain't gonna stop
So don't twist it up and make it something it's not
From handguns to bandwidth, I'm still kickin'
And I'll fry your ass like a piece of chicken

I'm still a DG and I ain't gonna stop
So don't twist it up and make it something it's not
From handguns to bandwidth, I'm still kickin'
And I'll fry your ass like a piece of chicken

I swear, people baffle me
Who the fuck would even want to battle me?
Boy what a fuckin' day that'll be
When their life disappears with their chattel, G
Don't battle me, because we rich in numbers
Every day see a couple of fresh newcomers
Tryin' to make a name off of my demise
And I always hit them up with the YT surprise
It may not happen right away, 'cause I lay in the weeds
And I strike like a snake, whenever I please
And such is the life of most DGs
You don't see it comin' 'til you're on your knees

Every time they try to weasel out of my trap
I pull them right back, put their heads in my lap
A little stressful, but I've got enough cigs
And I got enough to proxies to shake the pigs
Carton after carton of these 72s
And I'm still pullin' hits out my Underoos
I still bruise, pack up and DOS the server
Sit back and act like a calm observer
Call all the shots from miles away
Sittin' in a Starbucks at the break of day
I don't play, so act like you think you know
'Cause I'm a fuckin' DG, you're a fuckin' bitch, bro
Yeah!
