* [Android Hardening Guide by the TOR developers](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy)

  * This blog post describes the installation and configuration of a prototype
    of a secure, full-featured, Android telecommunications device with full Tor
    support, individual application firewalling, true cell network baseband
    isolation, and optional ZRTP encrypted voice and video support. ZRTP does
    run over UDP which is not yet possible to send over Tor, but we are able to
    send SIP account login and call setup over Tor independently. The SIP client
    we recommend also supports dialing normal telephone numbers if you have a
    SIP gateway that provides trunking service. Aside from a handful of binary
    blobs to manage the device firmware and graphics acceleration, the entire
    system can be assembled (and recompiled) using only FOSS components.
    However, as an added bonus, we will describe how to handle the Google Play
    store as well, to mitigate the two infamous Google Play Backdoors.

### Device Analysis

* [android-cluster-toolkit](https://github.com/jduck/android-cluster-toolkit)

  * The Android Cluster Toolkit helps organize and manipulate a collection of
    Android devices. It was designed to work with a collection of devices
    connected to the same host machine, either directly or via one or more tiers
    of powered USB hubs. The tools within can operate on single devices, a
    selected subset, or all connected devices at once.

* [Android Device Testing Framework(DTF)](https://github.com/jakev/dtf/tree/v1.0.3)

  * The Android Device Testing Framework ("dtf") is a data collection and
    analysis framework to help individuals answer the question: "Where are the
    vulnerabilities on this mobile device?" Dtf provides a modular approach and
    built-in APIs that allows testers to quickly create scripts to interact with
    their Android devices. The default download of dtf comes with multiple
    modules that allow testers to obtain information from their Android device,
    process this information into databases, and then start searching for
    vulnerabilities (all without requiring root privileges). These modules help
    you focus on changes made to AOSP components such as applications,
    frameworks, system services, as well as lower-level components such as
    binaries, libraries, and device drivers. In addition, you'll be able to
    analyze new functionality implemented by the OEMs and other parties to find
    vulnerabilities.

* [drozer](https://github.com/mwrlabs/drozer)

  * drozer allows you to search for security vulnerabilities in apps and devices
    by assuming the role of an app and interacting with the Dalvik VM, other

    cross-platform support. You can now have multiple frameworks installed &
    pick a particular one on a per project basis.

* [Smali Control-Flow-Graphs](https://github.com/EugenioDelfa/Smali-CFGs)

* [PID Cat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat)

  * An update to Jeff Sharkey's excellent logcat color script which only shows
    log entries for processes from a specific application package. During
    application development you often want to only display log messages coming
    from your app. Unfortunately, because the process ID changes every time you
    deploy to the phone it becomes a challenge to grep for the right thing. This
    script solves that problem by filtering by application package. Supply the
    target package as the sole argument to the python script and enjoy a more
    convenient development process.

* [AndBug - Scriptable Android Debugger](https://github.com/swdunlop/AndBug)

  * AndBug is a debugger targeting the Android platform's Dalvik virtual machine
    intended for reverse engineers and developers. It uses the same interfaces

    points (in-line hooking). The actual instrumentation code is written using
    the JNI interface. The DDI further supports loading additional dex classes
    into a process. This enables instrumentation code to be partially written in
    Java and thus simplifies interacting with the instrumented process and the
    Android framework.

* [Hooker](https://github.com/AndroidHooker/hooker)

    application. It leverages Android Substrate framework to intercept these
    calls and aggregate all their contextual information (parameters, returned
    values, ...). Collected information can either be stored in a distributed
    database (e.g. ElasticSearch) or in json files. A set of python scripts is
    also provided to automatize the execution of an analysis to collect any API
    calls made by a set of applications.

  * Android is currently the largest mobile platform with around 750 million
    devices worldwide. Unfortunately, more than 30% of all devices contain
    publicly known security vulnera- bilities and, in practice, cannot be
    updated through normal mechanisms since they are not longer supported by the
    man- ufacturer and mobile operator. This failure of traditional patch
    distribution systems has resulted in the creation of a large population of
    vulnerable mobile devices. In this paper, we present PatchDroid, a system to
    dis- tribute and apply third-party security patches for Android. Our system
    is designed for device-independent patch cre- ation, and uses in-memory
    patching techniques to address vulnerabilities in both native and managed
    code. We created a fully usable prototype of PatchDroid, including a number
    of patches for well-known vulnerabilities in Android devices. We evaluated
    our system on different devices from multiple manufacturers and show that we
    can effectively patch se- curity vulnerabilities on Android devices without
    impacting performance or usability. Therefore, PatchDroid represents a
    realistic path towards dramatically reducing the number of exploitable
    Android devices in the wild.

### Educational Material

* [OWASP GoatDroid](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_GoatDroid_Project)

  * OWASP GoatDroid is a fully functional and self-contained training
    environment for educating developers and testers on Android security.
    GoatDroid requires minimal dependencies and is ideal for both Android
    beginners as well as more advanced users. The project currently includes two
    applications: FourGoats, a location-based social network, and Herd
    Financial, a mobile banking application. There are also several feature that
    greatly simplify usage within a training environment or for absolute
    beginners who want a good introduction to working with the Android platform.

* [Insecure Bank v2](https://github.com/dineshshetty/Android-InsecureBankv2)

  * This vulnerable Android application is named "InsecureBankv2" and is made
    for security enthusiasts and developers to learn the Android insecurities by
    testing this vulnerable application. Its back-end server component is
    written in python. The client component i.e. the Android InsecureBank.apk
    can be downloaded along with the source code.

  * You're probably wondering how someone could possibly fill a 45 minute slot
    talking about the security implications of sockets (after all, there are
    only TCP and UDP sockets, right?). In reality, there are several unique
    types of sockets used by an Android device. These range from network sockets
    (the ones we are all familiar with), to local sockets, and even kernel-level
    sockets. When used improperly, these sockets can have devastating effects on
    the overall security of a device. In this talk, I'll discuss several types
    of Linux-based sockets found on Android devices and how these sockets have
    historically been used to compromise devices. I'll also provide the tools
    and techniques necessary to enumerate and interact with these sockets on
    your own device.

  * We identified a security weakness in Android's approach of handling UI
    elements, circumventing parts of Android's sandboxing approach. While this
    attack is simple from a technical point of view, the impact of exploiting
    such a vulnerability is significant. It affects Android based devices as
    well as Blackberry mobile devices running the Android runtime environment.

  * This is a project to port Android open source project to x86 platform,
    formerly known as "patch hosting for android x86 support". The original plan
    is to host different patches for android x86 support from open source
    community. A few months after we created the project, we found out that we
    could do much more than just hosting patches. So we decide to create our
    code base to provide support on different x86 platforms, and set up a git
    server to host it.
