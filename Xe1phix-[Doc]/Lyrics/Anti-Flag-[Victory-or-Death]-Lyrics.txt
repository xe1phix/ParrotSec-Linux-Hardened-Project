When the world starts burning ring the bell, ring the bell
We can say we can say we were there when it fell
Hear the voice of the choir fare thee well, fare thee well
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
You were born far away in the pouring rain
Dreaming I would meet you there someday
Well, I don't know your story and I don't know your name
But I can tell you that you won't die in vain
When the world starts burning ring the bell, ring the bell
We can say we can say we were there when it fell
Hear the voice of the choir fare thee well, fare thee well
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
When you come face to face with the weight of your fate
Count your blessing or just count your mistakes? (your mistakes)
When the sun begins to set on the things you never did
(Will they haunt you or the ones you have left?)
To the end of the day nothing left but to raise up a glass to the lost and the brave
You may be buried in a grave that is marked with no name
But I'll be thrown down in a hole just the same (just the same)
To arms the brave
Unknown soldiers wait
March on, march on to our very last breath
It's victory or death
When the world starts burning ring the bell, ring the bell
We can say we can say we were there when it fell
Hear the voice of the choir fare thee well, fare thee well
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
When the world starts burning ring the bell, ring the bell
We can say we can say we were there when it fell (when it fell)
Hear the voice of the choir fare thee well, fare thee well
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell (gave 'em hell)
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell (gave 'em hell)
We gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell, gave 'em hell
