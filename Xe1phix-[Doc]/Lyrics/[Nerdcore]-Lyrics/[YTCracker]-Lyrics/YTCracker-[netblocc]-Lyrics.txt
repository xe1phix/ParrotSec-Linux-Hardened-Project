bitch i got no life in me
scannin net bloccs while i'm sippin laced tea
i'm surfin round the world wide web - lonely
cause all these mothafuckas wanna clone me

bitches wanna own me - you phony - cook shells like macaroni
suicidal thoughts stuck in my head - i'm dying slowly
can't be with no bitch that wanna execute remotely
Spam God bless the draco - these rounds holy

yes i am a soldier - my heart growin colder lately
abusin many netbloccs - make these datacenters hate me
yes i see the feds creepin - think they wanna date me
i'm oilin up my choppa - cuttin off the fuckin safety

punk fuckin haters think my netblocc gon nullroute
these seven six two rounds upload you to the god damn cloud
punk fuckin haters think my netblocc gon nullroute
these seven six two rounds upload you to the god damn cloud
