[yung innanet]
Bitch watch me pivot loadin up the babydraco
Racks turn to heaters these cycles turn to monero
Sift through these diffs when they patchin all they shit code
Windows get broke they fix em but then i reload
Connections bounce untraceable accounts
Active directory domain names i can't pronounce
Im in ya house enumeratin routes
Despite the dirty traffic BGP will still announce
Server closet hot my heart is so cold
I'mma show you what the fuck i mean when i say pwned
Ain't grippin chrome got firefox and nitron
Evaluate my headers and get turned into a drone
Ring ring ring ring on the SIP phone
It ain't worth resistin you don't got the fuckin ohms
Thinkin I am history but my presence has grown
It may be yo domain but your network is my home

[Ohm-I]
I ain't scanning networks for practice
Checking ya ports I am scanning for access
Enumeratin' services better apply your patches
I'll search sploits. exploitDB knows what the hack is
Yo, you need fortify heavily
I see your database services and version 1 SMB
You know what this nerd gon' do payloads I'mma turn on you
This quad 4 make you sad forever that's ETERNALBLUE
Dumpin' hashes when I'm loading up that mimikatz
Creds to my boy John see how many he can crack
I smash and I grab on that lateral path
Ain't movin' blunts when I say that I'm passin the hash
Not a script kiddie they ain't the level I'm on
I'm a snake charmer watch me dance around some Python
And generate shellcode for services I find on ya network
Pop a shell I get right on

[Hook]
Your network security level way down
Nothing can stop us we'll find my way round
Taking over ya DC nothing is safe now
This might be your network but it's our domain now
Your network security level way down
Nothing can stop us we'll find my way round
Taking over ya DC nothing is safe now
This might be your network but it's our domain now

[yung innanet]
DNS fully qualified but ya admin's not
ASP.NET you deserve to rot
Yes I'mma grow this net till until the routes drop
Tell the ATF this an arm-brace this is not a stock
Babydraco make them opps go
Pippity pop pop pop now they die slow
Got the siggy on me if i need to touch some MIPSel
Memory small but yo credentials gon a big sell
Fuck electron my crodies some cloodhounds
Free atmos illkid from the dog pound
Find us in yo server and find us in ya damn clouds
When the cops come we vanish and we don't make a sound
Lookin like I talk a lot but I ain't never say shit
I don't fucking trust the cops so i could never ever be a snitch
Givin to the poor the resources we takin from the rich
Catch me creepin round layer 2 on your corporate switch

[Ohm-I]
No anti-virus products guess you never heard of those
I'm on that Willy Wonka got the golden ticket, Kerberos
You actively blind I'm tappin' ya lines, homey
All ya unsecure traffic is mine, homey
Why ya boss browsing porno in the work day
No good he 'bout a catch a virus in the worst way
He's staring at a lot of chicks but all that I'm gettin' out of it
That site he's peepin' is mining Monero with some Javascript
And I bet he won't like that
I'm just tryna get paid to be a white hat
Open my report and I'mma write that and
Show the impact of an attacker and put â€˜em on the right track
I'll advise you invest
In a HIDS or a NIDS or a fly IPS
Better firewall ya ports and deny that egress
Or I'll deliver a payload right to ya chest

[Hook]
Your network security level way down
Nothing can stop us we'll find my way round
Taking over ya DC nothing is safe now
This might be your network but it's our domain now
Your network security level way down
Nothing can stop us we'll find my way round
Taking over ya DC nothing is safe now
This might be your network but it's our domain now
