What does um
Wh-wh-what does WP-login mean
Whats that uh?
Oh thats-thats got to be one of these wiz kids right
Thats one of the
You guys are doing the-the computer thing right?
Oh I've heard about this, I've heard about that
Thats crazy thats really cool

I don't give a fucc cause I sticc to my principles
Injest the data I substanciate these literals
I find it really pitiful
You act like my impact is oh so minimal
But I find it so critical
Imma make sure you get it tho
I-roll-slow where-the fucc your data go
The crew go postal if you really try to play me hoe
I'm fuccin with this meta, I know wherе the peices go
You fuccin with thеse bitches they really gonna end you bro
TCP direct be the set, pushing malware to the internet
Do you wanna bet, wanna do some shit you might regret
I put my work in for years and what the fucc I get
How do you look at your peers and expect their respect

When one appealing to the law against their fellow men
They either a fool or a coward, so tell me where you stand
Do think you be here but really think you understand
The way we bend these packets it ain't no hosting plan

I'm sorry for jay-walking its just...ah-the crosswalk...

Rect be the set, pushing malware to the internet
Do you wanna bet, wanna do some shit you might regret

TCP direct be the set, pushing malware to the internet
We put work in for years and what the fucc we get
How do you look at your peers and expect their respect?

Oh well I don't know
The shirts look really cool
You know I mean I think everyone at work would think I was like a hacker
That'd be cool huh?
