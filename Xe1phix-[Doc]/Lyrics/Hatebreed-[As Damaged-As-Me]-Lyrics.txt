Hatebreed - As Damaged As Me

You knew just where to touch
Your words always cut
So much darker than lust
We both longed for trust
So much more than just hate
My hands there to suffocate
So deep I penetrate

When you're as damaged as me
To punish yourself is to love
When you're as damaged as me
You relish in the pain of another

We were destined to fuck
You knew how hard to touch
We were destined to fuck each other
We were destined to fuck
Your words always cut
We were destined to fuck each other

Over!

When you're as damaged as me
Your eyes say what we know
And when you're damaged like me
You like hands upon your throat
When you're as damaged as me
You know you're to fucked for words
And when you're damaged like me
You take what you don't deserve

Inflict the damage!

You take what you don't deserve
What you don't deserve
You take what you don't deserve
You don't deserve
You take what you don't deserve
Now you to fucked for words

You're to fucked for words
Now you're just fucked
You were to fucked for words
Now you're just fucked
You're fucked!

You're to fucked for words
Now you're just fucked!
