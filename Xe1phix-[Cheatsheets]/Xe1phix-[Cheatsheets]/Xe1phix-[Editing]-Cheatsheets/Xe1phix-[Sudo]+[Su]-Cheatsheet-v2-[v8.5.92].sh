#su vs sudo
#"sudo" asks for your password,"su" asks for the password for the user whom you are switching to
#sudo lets you issue commands as another user without changing your identity,entry in /etc/sudoers to execute these restricted permissions
#without entering the root password
#su keeps the environment of the old/original user even after the switch to root 
#creates a new environment (as dictated by the ~/.bashrc of the root user), 
#similar to the case when you explicitly log in as root user from the log-in screen.

"sudo su"
"sudo -i"
su is equivalent to sudo -i
gives you the root environment, i.e. your ~/.bashrc is ignored.
simulates a login into the root account
Your working directory will be /root
will read root's .profile


"sudo -s" 
gives you the user's environment, so your ~/.bashrc is respected.
launches a shell as root
doesn't change your working directory

"sudo bash" #runs bash as a super user
sudo -E #The -E (preserve environment) option indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their existing environment variables.
