Wannacry Lyrics
Fuck this world
Sometimes I think that I am through
I only want the data if the information is new
I need that cryptographic proof
That mathematical truth
Im having dreams of my body hanging from a noose

What the fuck I told you yeah I'm dead inside
Every single day I see less and less of the light
My life encapsulated within these encrypted bits and bytes
Yeah you looking like a leak, enumerate your website
Very scary sight when my demons arise
You looking for pain then bitch just look into my eyes
They be tеlling them lies
I see right through they disguisе
The truth lays within the leaks from servers I compromise
It ain't no logitech when I let that thing click
Its a 30 round clip in the magazine into my stick
Yes I am the wave I'm making these snitches sea sick
I cannot be saved, destruction I cannot cease it

Destruction I cannot cease it
Destruction I cannot cease it

Yes I am the wave I'm making these bitches sea sick
I cannot be saved, destruction I cannot cease it

Step inside of my dojo
Yes we got them things gottem for the low low
Hit em with that low blow
Barrel out the window
Creeping around your block in the rust bucket moving slow slow

Love is dead all these bitches do is lane switch
I'm real sorry I forgot your damn name trick
Pull up and I bang it
I leave your whole crew nameless
Credential rearranging
Your passwords get to changin

I'm blaming myself
Knowing no one can save me from this decline of mental health
Call me santa I got .ELFs
Executables that melt
Knowing no amount of wealth is likely to provide me...
Help
