good evening everyone, 
and welcome again to channel 23 KSEC news, 
i'm skip turner.

a local hacker, 
fed up with the current state of the internet, 
has released a multi-platform application 
to create a sizable encrypted mesh network 
using all types of electronic devices. 
upon running the application, 
mobile phones, tablets, routers, laptops, televisions, 
and even some household smart appliances 
like toasters and refrigerators 
are turned into peer-to-peer nodes 
for the network, wirelessly broadcasting and receiving data 
from any other connected gadgets within range.

the developer, known only as "neals"
began distributing the application along with its 
source code to san secuestro locals yesterday. 
according to the available network statistics,
the app has been installed on at least 
a quarter million devices already.

government officials have commented that this type of privacy application violates federal law 
by subverting the current ban on unlicensed encrypted traffic.

"this application is clearly designed to make our job of protecting the people of this great nation 
 more difficult, possibly subjecting our precious children to everything from anonymous cyberbullying 
 to heinous acts of terrorism. 
 circumvention of these laws is itself an act of terrorism, 
 and we will prosecute whoever is responsible for designing and distributing this application 
 to the fullest extent of the law."

anyone with information regarding this case is advised 
to contact the local Federal Bureau of Telecommunications field office.
