fuck sometimes i think i'm helpless
playing with live rounds - no pellets
all these bitches become jealous
but i'm alone - my brain meltin
--
miss the days that i was sellin
legal narcotics to felons
no bitch we ain't never tellin
crack his head just like a melon
--
feels like its been ages since i had to let the hammer drop
beefin on computers i suggest you bring it to a stop
yeah i see yo psyop - i play dumb - you need another plot
i had a vision: i let opposition decompose and rot
--
you all talk - ya hide behind socks
i hear you squackin - fuck around you and get rocc'd
connections get dropped - bodies outlined in chalk
information disclosure when i proceed to zone walk
----
six six six - illuminate the pathway
bitch bitch bitch - you want smoke it can go dat way
yeah yo bitch wanna meet me - but that hoe be so nasty
i think i'd rather go to dinner with some fuckin ascii
--
i ain't respondin to these stupid questions ya askin
i'm about to put the 9 to my head and start blastin
if i don't blast myself - yo crew might be shoppin for caskets
i become more trigger happy the more time that be passin
--
still on tha innanet - chasin down computas
i dissassemble these booters - i think you boys need some tutors
and the draco stay loaded for the ops and the intruders
never tell my left ear what my right ear get told about maneuvers
--
yeah bitch i do shit the hard way
i leave the opposition prayin for some better days
my mind a little fogged up cause i stay in a daze
because i'm tryn'ta keep these suicidal thoughts at bay

----- @tcpstack -----

too much drugs inside my system
thats a buffer overflow

catch me pouring up this actavis
i might just overload
car is looking suicidal hit the switch and
flip the door
opposition claim they friendly, people i dont even know
i construct my own reality, the pen my fucking typecast
fuck your personality cause bots are known to die fast
mind is an enigma holding back the static ice blast
i am unrestricted, they conforming like an ipad
focusing my cataracts
precision swiping data hacks
offloading them with mad finesse
you'll never get that data back
losing packets, avalanche
1 lick, new fit, 1 cash advance
they mad upset, come grab the mans
i stack my guap expanding bands
--
losing my mind
people will die
shot in the head watch em fall from the sky
i wont think twice
stealing your life
you got no value but you got a price
--
i,
think i might just drop this
mm, i,
see you through the optic
hit you in eye,

incapacitate the opp in-
side
got nowhere to hide
thermal vision is my guide
we illuminate your block with
nines
