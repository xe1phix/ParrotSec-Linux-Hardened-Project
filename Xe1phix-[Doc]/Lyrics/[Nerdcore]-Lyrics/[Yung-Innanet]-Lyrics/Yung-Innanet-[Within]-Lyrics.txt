@dicepticon and i dive into our darker side

hey
try to live without the downside
but the enemy lives within
within
hey
try to blend in with the outside
but i cant even begin
begin
i
colored outside the lines
trying to pave my way
im ok
im
a product of modern times
trying to save my day
in decay

dont know when ill finally be gone
thin as a whisper im hanging on

save me from myself
deliver me from these demons in my head
save me from myself
or find a way to end it all instead
