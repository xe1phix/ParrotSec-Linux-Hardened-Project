it's early morning - or is it later evening?
i dont know cuz ive been spending most my hours sleeping
start having trouble breathing when the thought of even leaving
the safety of my bedroom cross my mind for any reason
havent been eating - aside from old stale lays
that have been sitting on my dresser for days
my jet black curtains block out most of the rays
and keep me safe in my continued malaise

i tell myself that im just suffering a phase
the disarray that i experience; a chemical shift
but when the problem's in your head to begin with
it's difficult to tell yourself any different
start the circular thinking i feel like im sinking
i feel like im worthless and my self confidence is constantly shrinking
i keep my phone off keep the world at a respectable distance
cuz i got issues with respect to existence

it's early morning - or is it later evening?
ive been up at least a week without a nap and im beaming
im fucking jesus and the world is fucking privileged to have me
illuminating every room i enter spreading my happy
the universe has chosen me the beacon the bastion of hope
im on a scale thats hubble size in the scope
aint a soul who can control me diety to undo me
cuz im infallible the universe has spoken it to me

zero need for medication i dont need that shit invading
my brainspace erasing all this progress im making
i got a handle in control electricity shooting
out my fingers feel the power like i was vladimir putin
i didnt spend my whole life hacking and rooting
to get outsmarted by a little bit of mental pollutant
i got a highfalutin self image to ride on
spitting out this art im that lyrical krylon

wait a minute - is my calendar broken?
seems like only yesterday i's captain and coking
just to cope with a depression now months passed in a motion
and ive promiscuously processed every fish in the ocean
bank account is wide open lost 20 grand on the oakland
as - how could i even bet that much in two days?
my life recounted to me in the third person
thats what i get for going outside the curtain

i cant believe some of the things im recalling
i cant believe i went that reckless that behaviors appalling
but in the thick of mania the brain will get you ensconced
in a world where consequences have no place among wants

it's early morning - or is it later evening?
i cant even trust my own eyes to not be deceiving
im on a pendulum where either extreme
is self destructive not productive in achieving a dream
the slender edges on each end provide the reason for living
but i can never stay there long enough to comfortably fit in
bipolar prison trapped between a grandiose rock
and a hard place made of beta male "adios" talk

any alternative is equally tragic
because any way you cut it im just feeding an addict
im either feeding him pills to keep his spectrum in check
or im feeding him pills to keep his spectrum in check
russian roulette but wont consider trading conditions
a normal existence is not cut out for beating these missions
and no commander ever made it without beating the odds
early mornings into evenings turn my demons to gods
